### Story Pitch:
This app is designed for users to be able to give and receive advice regarding anything adventure/traveling related. Not only can they give and receive advice, but will be able to save their favorite blog posts so they can come back to them time and time again. This app makes searching for places to adventure and travel to, as well as finding things to do there and getting information about the place, culture, and people, very easy and convenient, and all in one place; also from people's first hand experiences!!
